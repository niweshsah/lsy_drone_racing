# Benchmarks

These benchmarks are intended to test the performance of the implementation, i.e. speed and memory consumption. They are not meant to benchmark different approaches, algorithms or agents in the race task!

## Profiling
To profile the simulation, use [pyinstrument](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument) and run

>: pyinstrument -r html profile.py
