"""
A reactive state controller that uses the observation data to
dynamically generate a smooth cubic spline trajectory.

This version uses "chordal" parameterization (actual distance)
for the spline 's' variable. This prevents the spline from
"overshooting" the waypoints and makes the path more geometrically
accurate, avoiding collisions with the gate.
