"""Controller that follows a pre-defined trajectory.

It uses a cubic spline interpolation to generate a smooth trajectory through a series of waypoints.
At each time step, the controller computes the next desired position by evaluating the spline.

.. note::
    The waypoints are hard-coded in the controller for demonstration purposes. In practice, you
    would need to generate the splines adaptively based on the track layout, and recompute the
    trajectory if you receive updated gate and obstacle poses.
